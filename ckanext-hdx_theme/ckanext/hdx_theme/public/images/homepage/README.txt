The logo images are pretty bad quality as you can see. But they’re the ones used on humanitarianresponse and reliefWeb.  


I also included bigger images of the social media icons in case these little ones aren’t good, they look a little weird to me.


But they ultimately should be 30X30px.  And you’d need to put a white color fill over them, as I did for the smaller ones.
