These categories of core data, determined from research with our users, may be customized to meet the needs of specific countries and the evolving data needs of humanitarian response.

The major goal of the library is to make pushing and pulling data from HDX as simple as possible for the end user. There are several ways this is achieved. It provides a simple interface that communicates with HDX using the CKAN Python API, a thin wrapper around the CKAN REST API. The HDX objects, such as datasets and resources, are represented by Python classes. This should make the learning curve gentle and enable users to quickly get started with using HDX programmatically. For example, to read a dataset and get its resources, you would simply do:</p>\n<pre><code class="python">from hdx.hdx_configuration import Configuration \r\nfrom hdx.data.dataset import Dataset\r\nConfiguration.create(hdx_site=\'prod\', user_agent=\'A_Quick_Example\', hdx_read_only=True)\'\r\ndataset = Dataset.read_from_hdx(\'reliefweb-crisis-app-data\')\r\nresources = dataset.get_resources()\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>There is <a href="http://ocha-dap.github.io/hdx-python-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">library API-level documentation</a> available online.<br />\nIf you intend to push data to HDX, then it may be helpful to start with this <a href="https://github.com/OCHA-DAP/hdxscraper-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scraper template</a> which shows what needs to be done to create datasets on HDX.

The most recent versions support Python 3 only, but there are earlier versions with Python 2.7 support. Features of the library include filtering, validation and the ingestion and generation of various formats. libhxl-python uses an idiom that is familiar from JQuery and other Javascript libraries; for example, to load a dataset, you would use simply</p>\n<pre><code>import hxl \r\nsource = hxl.data(\'http://example.org/dataset.xlsx\')</code></pre>\n<p>As in JQuery, you process the dataset by adding additional steps to the chain. The following example selects every row with the organisation &#8220;UNICEF&#8221; and removes the column with email addresses:</p>\n<pre><code>source.with_rows(\'#org=UNICEF\').without_columns(\'#contact+email\')</code></pre>\n<p>The library also includes a set of command-line tools for processing HXL data in shell scripts. For example, the following will perform the same operation shown above, without the need to write Python code:</p>\n<pre><code>$ cat dataset.xlsx | hxlselect -q "#org=UNICEF" | hxlcut -x \'#contact+email\'</code></pre>\n<p>There is library <a href="http://hxlstandard.github.io/libhxl-python/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API-level documentation</a> available online.</p>\n',

Data sensitivity definitions may also be found in applicable privacy or data protection legislation. In the absence of such guidance, any data that may put certain individuals, groups or organizations at risk of harm in a particular context should be considered sensitive. While personal data can categorically be considered sensitive, more nuanced issues arise for non-personal data. For example, locations of medical facilities in conflict settings can expose patients and staff to risk, while the same data would not necessarily be considered sensitive in a natural disaster response context.</p>\n<p>In the health sector specifically, all identifiable data concerning health, factors influencing health (for example, cultural and socio-economic details) and the history of individuals are sensitive and must be handled with care and professionalism. In addition, any data (identifiable or not) that can be voluntarily or involuntarily misused against the interests of patients, potential patients, their family, groups or communities and/or health service providers or other humanitarian organizations and their staff, or put any of them at risk for political reasons, financial gain or any other reasons shall be treated as &#8220;highly sensitive&#8221; data.
