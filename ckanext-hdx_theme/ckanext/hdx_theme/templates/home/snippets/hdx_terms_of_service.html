  	The following are an initial draft of the basic Terms of Service for data shared 
  	through the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) platform. Let us know what you think by contacting us through

			HDX is for the purpose of sharing humanitarian data with a global community of users. 
			Humanitarian data is defined as: 1) any data that is used to understand the context in which a humanitarian crisis is 
			occurring (e.g. baseline data); and 2) any data that is about the people affected by the crisis and their needs, and the 
			response by organizations and individuals seeking to help those people in need of assistance.
		{% endtrans %}
		</li>
		<li>
		{% trans %}
			Only registered users will be able to share data through the platform. Anonymous or non-registers users of the platform 
			will only be able to browse data that has been shared by others.
		{% endtrans %}
		</li>
		<li>
		{% trans %}
			HDX will not store personal identifying information. All data shared through the platform must be sufficiently aggregated 
			or anonymized so as to prevent identification of individuals or other harm to affected people and the humanitarian community.
		{% endtrans %}
		</li>
		<li>
		{% trans %}
			Organizations or individuals sharing data through the platform should ensure, to the extent possible, that all data was 
			collected in a legal, ethical and responsible manner, including: 
		{% endtrans %}
			<ol type="a">
				<li>
				{% trans %}
					 Obtaining informed consent from individuals or communities when possible. 
				{% endtrans %}
				</li>
				<li>
				{% trans %}
					 When informed consent cannot be obtained, that data is gathered with appropriate safeguards, 
					 including a privacy impact assessment.  
				{% endtrans %}
				</li>
				<li>
				{% trans %}
					 Efforts were made to avoid duplication of data collection efforts in order to avoid an unnecessary 
					 burden by affected individuals and communities. 
				{% endtrans %}
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
		{% trans %}
			Registered users have the option to share data publicly or privately through the platform. Public data can be 
			shared under a user-selected Creative Commons license or as public domain. Private data is only shared with the 
			HDX users who have been given access to the data by the data contributor.
		{% endtrans %}
		</li>
		<li>
		{% trans %}
			Data shared privately through the platform will never be shared by OCHA as platform administrator without consent. 
			Private data will be held securely and regular checks will be run on the HDX system to test for breaches.
		{% endtrans %}
		</li>
		<li>
		{% trans %}
			Should a user become aware of data shared through the HDX platform that could cause harm by being shared openly, 
			the user should contact
		{% endtrans %}
			<a href="mailto:hdx@un.org">hdx@un.org</a> 
			{% trans %}immediately to request that the data be removed.{% endtrans %}
		</li>
		<li>
		{% trans %}
			Users can share both curated and uncurated data through the platform. The level of data validation will be clearly 
			indicated through the user interface.
		{% endtrans %}
		</li>
		<li>
		{% trans %}
			Data shared through the HDX platform will be held indefinitely or until such a time that the data contributor deletes it, 
			or there is a request from a user for it to be deleted. In the latter case, the user would have to provide a convincing 
			reason (e.g. privacy) and possibly also supporting evidence for the claim.
		{% endtrans %}
		</li>
		<li>
		{% trans %}
			If a data source becomes aware of data that has been shared through the HDX platform by a third party and disagrees 
			with it being shared, the data source should contact
		{% endtrans %}
			<a href="mailto:hdx@un.org">hdx@un.org</a> 
			{% trans %} to request that the data be removed.{% endtrans %}
		</li>
		<li>
		{% trans %}
			If OCHA as system administrator of the HDX platform becomes aware of any data that is in violation of these 
			Terms of Service, OCHA will contact the individual or organization to notify them.
		{% endtrans %}
