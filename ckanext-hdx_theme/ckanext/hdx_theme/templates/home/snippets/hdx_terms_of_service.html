					The purpose of HDX platform is to enable the sharing of data across the humanitarian community. Humanitarian data is defined as: 1) any data that is used to understand the context in which a humanitarian crisis is occurring (e.g. baseline data); and 2) any data that is about the people affected by the crisis and their needs, and the response by organisations and individuals seeking to help those people in need of assistance.				
				{% endtrans %}
				</li>
				<li>
				{% trans %}
					Only approved organisations are able to share data through the platform.
				{% endtrans %}
				</li>
				<li>
				{% trans %}
					HDX will not store personal identifying information. All data shared through the platform must be sufficiently aggregated or anonymized so as to prevent identification of individuals or other harm to affected people and the humanitarian community.
				{% endtrans %}
				</li>
				<li>
				{% trans %}
					Organisations sharing data through the platform should ensure, to the extent possible, that all data was collected in a legal, ethical and responsible manner, including: 
				{% endtrans %}
					<ol type="a">
						<li>
						{% trans %}
							 Obtaining informed consent from individuals or communities when possible. 
						{% endtrans %}
						</li>
						<li>
						{% trans %}
							 When informed consent cannot be obtained, that data is gathered with appropriate safeguards, including a privacy impact assessment.  
						{% endtrans %}
						</li>
						<li>
						{% trans %}
							 Efforts were made to avoid duplication of data collection in order to avoid an unnecessary burden by affected individuals and communities.
						{% endtrans %}
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
				{% trans %}
					Organisations have the option to share data publicly or privately through the platform. Public data can be shared under a user-selected Creative Commons license or as public domain. Private data will only be accessible to members of the organisation.
				{% endtrans %}
				</li>
				<li>
				{% trans %}
					Data shared privately through the platform will never be shared by OCHA as platform administrator without consent. Private data will be held securely and regular checks will be run on the HDX system to test for breaches.
				{% endtrans %}
				</li>
				<li>
				{% trans %}
					Should a user become aware of data shared through the HDX platform that could cause harm by being shared openly, the user should contact 
				{% endtrans %}<a href="mailto:hdx@un.org">hdx@un.org</a>{% trans %} immediately to request that the data be removed.{% endtrans %}
				</li>
				<li>
				{% trans %}
					Users can share both curated and uncurated data through the platform. We will aim to make the level of data validation clear through the user interface in future iterations of HDX.
				{% endtrans %}
				</li>
				<li>
				{% trans %}
					Data shared through the HDX platform will be held indefinitely or until such a time that the data contributor deletes it, or there is a request from a user for it to be deleted. In the latter case, the user would have to provide a convincing reason (e.g. privacy) and possibly also supporting evidence for the claim.
				{% endtrans %}
				</li>
				<li>
				{% trans %}
					If a data source becomes aware of data that has been shared through the HDX platform by a third party and disagrees with it being shared, the data source should contact 
				{% endtrans %}<a href="mailto:hdx@un.org">hdx@un.org</a>{% trans %} to request that the data be removed.{% endtrans %}
				</li>
				<li>
				{% trans %}
					If OCHA as system administrator of the HDX platform becomes aware of any data that is in violation of these Terms of Service, OCHA will contact the individual or organization to notify them.
				{% endtrans %}
