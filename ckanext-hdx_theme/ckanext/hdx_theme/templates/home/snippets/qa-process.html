            The HDX team is notified that a new resource has been uploaded, which kickstarts the quality

          <div class="qa-process-description">
            All datasets containing microdata and/or seeming to contain sensitive information are placed under review.
            Microdata can be shared on HDX. However, before making these datasets available publicly, our team runs a
            disclosure risk assessment to protect individuals and vulnerable groups. While a dataset is under review,
            users will only be able to consult metadata or request the dataset directly from the data contributor.
            The dataset will remain under review until we are able to determine that the risk of re-identification is
            below our risk threshold and that any sensitive data has been removed from the dataset.

          </div>
          <div class="qa-process-description">
            We conduct the disclosure risk assessment in our secure environment using a free and open source tool
            called sdcMicro. If we determine that the risk of disclosure is below our 3% threshold and no
            individual respondents are found to have a high risk of re- identification, the dataset is considered safe
            to be publicly shared. If the dataset has a risk of re-identification above our threshold, we notify the
            data contributor and provide support to ensure that they are able to safely share the data. We may advise
            the contributor to reduce the risk of disclosure by applying Statistical Disclosure Control or,
            alternatively, to make the dataset available on request - through HDX connect.
