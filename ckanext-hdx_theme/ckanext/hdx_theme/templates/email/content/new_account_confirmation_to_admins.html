<p>Dear {{ data.org_name }} administrator(s),

<p>As requested, we have created a new HDX user account with the name {{ data.user_username }}. The account credentials were sent to
  {{ data.user_email }}.</p>

<p>The new account for {{ data.user_username }} was assigned the role of
  {% if data.capacity == 'admin' %} <strong>administrator</strong>: add, edit, and delete datasets, and manage organisation membership.
  {% elif data.capacity == 'editor' %} <strong>editor</strong>: add, edit, and delete datasets.
  {% elif data.capacity == 'member'  %} <strong>member</strong>: view all of an organisation's datasets (including private datasets).
  {% endif %}
</p>

<p>If this account was created in error, or if you require any additional assistance, please reply to this email. </p>
