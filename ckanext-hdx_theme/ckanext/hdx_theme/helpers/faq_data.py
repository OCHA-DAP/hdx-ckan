            'a': 'HDX continually seeks to understand the behavior of users on our site in order to improve the HDX service. To do so we use third-party analytics services including Google Analytics and Mixpanel. Both of these services use cookies stored on our users\' devices to send encrypted information to Google Analytics and Mixpanel about how the user arrived at HDX, what pages they visited on HDX, and their actions within those pages. Similar tracking is performed when users access HDX via our API or when directly downloading files from a shared link. HDX does not send identifying information (name, user name, email address) to Mixpanel or Google Analytics. Google Analytics\' and Mixpanel\'s use of the data collected from HDX is governed by their respective Terms of Use. </br></br><p>If you would like to disable the tracking described above, you can install the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a> to disable Google Analytics tracking. You can <a href="http://mixpanel.com/optout">opt out</a> of Mixpanel\'s tracking, but please note that your opt out is browser-specific and will be reversed if your cookies are deleted. Opting out does not affect tracking on direct file downloads on HDX. The data collected by these tracking systems will be retained indefinitely in order to understand how user behavior is changing over time. </br></br><p>Emails sent by the HDX mailing list (administered by MailChimp) may contain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_beacon">web beacons</a>, which allow us to track information about how many people have viewed our email campaigns. HDX will never share individually-identifiable information from this tracking to third parties.
