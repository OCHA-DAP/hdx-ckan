Description: 
        Pylons
        ======
        
        The Pylons web framework is aimed at making webapps and large programmatic
        website development in Python easy. Several key points:
        
        * A framework to make writing web applications in Python easy
        
        * Utilizes a minimalist, component-based philosophy that makes it easy to
          expand on
        
        * Harness existing knowledge about Python
        
        Knowing Python makes Pylons easy
        ---------------------------------
        
        Pylons makes it easy to expand on your knowledge of Python to master Pylons for
        web development. Using a MVC style dispath, Python knowledge is used at various
        levels:
        
        * The Controller is just a basic Python class, called for each
          request. Customizing the response is as easy as overriding __call__ to make
          your webapp work how you want.
        
        * Mako templating compiles directly to Python byte-code for speed and utilizes
          Python for template control rather than creating its own template syntax for
          "for, while, etc"
