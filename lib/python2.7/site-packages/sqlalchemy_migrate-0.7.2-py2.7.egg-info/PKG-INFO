Description: Inspired by Ruby on Rails' migrations, Migrate provides a way to deal with
        database schema changes in `SQLAlchemy <http://sqlalchemy.org>`_ projects.
        
        Migrate extends SQLAlchemy to have database changeset handling. It provides a
        database change repository mechanism which can be used from the command line as
        well as from inside python code.
