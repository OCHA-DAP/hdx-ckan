HDX: Humanitarian Data Exchange
===============================


General Information
-------------------

`The Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) <https://data.humdata.org/>`_ is an open platform for sharing data across crises and organisations.
Launched in July 2014, the goal of HDX is to make humanitarian data easy to find and use for analysis.
Our growing collection of datasets has been accessed by users in over 200 countries and territories.

HDX is open-source and is based on
`CKAN <https://github.com/ckan/ckan>`_, an open-source data management system that is behind many popular internet data portals.
